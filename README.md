## Emma Beynon
I'm an enthusiastic junior developer with a passion for empowering women in tech and building exciting projects with code.  After deciding to forgo a successful and established career in digital marketing in favour of the great coding unknown, I joined Makers Academy to facilitate a complete career change in to tech.  I am now seeking a challenging and fulfilling junior developer role in a supportive team that is passionate about personal growth and learning.


## Skills

#### Problem-solving
My previous career involved setting and hitting a lot of targets, particularly for revenue.  As such, it was crucial that I aimed to solve the problem of 'How can we grow our business as much as possible?'.  I tackled this with the following approach:
- Following best practice to ensure that campaigns are as well-optimised as possible
- Seeking out new opportunities by keeping up to date with the latest developments in the industry
- Researching ideas and solutions online with the extensive digital marketing community and trying everything possible to hit targets
- I delivered year-over-year revenue growth for all of my clients, including 55% YoY growth for Made.com

#### Detail-oriented
In each of my roles it has been a necessity to pay a lot of attention to detail.  When large budgets, revenue targets and the company's brand are on the line, making costly mistakes is not an option.
- Campaign ads were rigorously checked for spelling, grammatical and product information errors before publishing
- Built out campaigns in a well-structured and sustainable way to avoid having to fix rushed architectural decisions in the future
- Conducted ad and landing page A/B testing in a methodical manner to improve results and better understand what works

#### Communication
- Communicated performance and strategy to senior stakeholders at Moo.com and Rentify in a clear, minimally technical manner
- Dealt with rapidly shifting client needs while working at iCrossing, which required managing expectations and pushing back when necessary
- Confident presenter having led client meetings at iCrossing, presented to the board at Rentify and presented my final project to 100+ people at Makers Academy

#### Analytical skills
- As a paid search professional my day-to-day work has been centered around making optimisation decisions based on data analysis
- I am comfortable manipulating large data sets and extracting insights to inform my optimisation strategies

#### Teamwork
- At iCrossing I worked with a team of analysts and account managers to deliver successful PPC campaigns to clients
- At Makers Academy I worked in a team with 5 other students to collaboratively produce the Senes app
- Pair programmed daily at Makers Academy to solve coding problems and teach each other the curriculum

#### Leadership
- Managed a team of four Paid Search Analysts at iCrossing, including producing personal development plans and managing resource
- Led paid search strategy for key clients at iCrossing
- In my client-side roles at Moo.com and Rentify I was the internal point of contact for paid media and was responsible for the most significant part of the UK team's marketing budget (c. Â£150k per month)
